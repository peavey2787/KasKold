<!-- KasKold: Kaspa signing and wallet platform -->

- Harden Vault PSKT consensus semantics: `subnetworkId`, `gas`, and `txPayload` are now first-class transaction fields and are serialized canonically from the signed model rather than preserved as opaque extensions.
- Replace count-only PSKT/KSPT completion and consumer signature-progress status with key-bound BIP340 verification over the exact SIGHASH_ALL transaction digest; invalid, duplicate, extra, or misbound signatures cannot satisfy completion.
- Companion wallet selection now returns to the dashboard immediately after local kpub activation while balance/UTXO refresh continues in the background, and Advanced → View kpub renders the generated QR code as an image instead of escaped SVG text.

- Companion dashboard UX: reorganized loaded-wallet actions into a 2×2 icon grid (Send KAS, Receive, Multisig, Advanced), moved Tokens/History/Portfolio into a subtle one-line dashboard row, made the settings cog open Node Connection directly, renamed visible kpub-management language to Wallet Management, added the requested conventional Advanced menu, restored "Unload wallet", and suppresses redundant bottom navigation for short asset inventories.
# Changelog

All notable changes to KasKold are documented in this file. Historical KasSigner entries are retained for upstream provenance and compatibility context.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.0.0] - Unreleased
- Fixed Companion Advanced → Addresses → Verify Address so QR codes render normally instead of exposing escaped SVG markup, long addresses remain contained and readable, and Copy Address stays on the verification screen with copy feedback.
- Simplified Vault transaction review to the hardware-style essentials (total amount, total fee, verified destination address(es), and change), defaulted amounts to comma-grouped 8-decimal KAS with a KAS/SOMPI toggle, removed the signed-QR mode-choice step, added Back/Pause/Forward response controls with click-to-copy QR Frame Hex, changed signed-response saving to QR PNG images, and added per-frame hex ingestion to Companion signed-QR scanning.
- Vault footer now reads `Secure signer · No network access`, and Companion Send KAS formats Available balances like the dashboard (grouped with two KAS decimal places).

- Fixed Companion Web CRAP/runtime coverage so the malformed-boundary sweep no longer boots the long-lived application entrypoint or startup node retry loop; refreshed stale unload, Send Max, camera-fallback, and View-kpub architecture contracts so Windows QA completes without runaway resolver logging or Node heap exhaustion.
- Refined Vault/Companion public-key UX: Vault saved-wallet credentials now submit on Enter, Connect places the textual kpub below its QR, Scan QR receives the shared Back/Home navigation pair, and About no longer repeats the Vault wordmark; Companion Advanced now exposes View kpub with both QR and full text plus copy support.
- Unified Vault Web startup and Wallet → Switch / Add Wallet on the same persisted-wallet picker, with saved-wallet credential unlock and a single + add/import entry; moved Web signer/version copy to the app footer, made the Vault wordmark a Home control, moved Home beside iconized Back controls, normalized Wallet → Backup styling across Vault Web/Android/iOS, and kept recovery-word Continue enabled after Show All.
- Corrected Companion loading-screen state copy: startup node connection messaging is now reserved for the actual connection gate, wallet load/switch operations retain wallet-specific wording while balances refresh, and the loading-screen note is dynamically matched to the operation instead of always claiming the app is waiting for a node.
- Companion now uses an in-theme confirmation dialog for wallet unload instead of the browser-native confirmation prompt.
### KasKold migration
- Rebased KasKold on the hardened KasSigner 2.0 architecture while preserving upstream GPL attribution, historical provenance, and compatibility-critical legacy protocol/domain identifiers.
- Rebranded the product family as **KasKold Hardware**, **KasKold Companion**, and **KasKold Vault**, with canonical shared logo assets for firmware, Web, Android, iOS, and documentation.
- Enforced a strict watch-only boundary for **KasKold Companion Web/Android/iOS**: Companion manages kpubs and online wallet state, constructs transactions, transports signing requests, finalizes signed responses, and broadcasts, but cannot create/restore wallets, own private keys, or sign locally. Removed the prior Session/Persistent Hot Wallet product paths from every Companion surface.
- Added the shared Rust software-custody backend behind `vault-runtime` and dedicated **Vault Web/Android/iOS** applications. Vault apps own wallet creation/restore/public-account export, KSPT QR scan/review/explicit approval/signing, and signed-response framing. Vault Web contains no blockchain watcher/node/broadcast path; Android intentionally omits the `INTERNET` permission and iOS has no networking implementation.
- Retired the unqualified Waveshare target and its board-specific camera, SDHOST, touch, power, display, boot, diagnostic, partition, enclosure, release, HIL, and QA paths. CoreS3 remains the hardware-qualified production target; CoreS3 Lite shares the CoreS3 implementation profile but remains qualification-pending.
- Added automated KasKold branding, custody-boundary, Vault network-isolation, CoreS3 Lite profile, repository inventory, and security-evidence regression gates.
- Fixed the KasKold brand-audit gate so the security-guide generator's explicit compatibility wording is allowed only at its owned documentation source, while the same upstream wording remains rejected from ordinary UI/product surfaces.
- Regenerated the user-facing guide PDFs under KasKold/Companion names and updated build/release/developer documentation for the CoreS3 family.

### Security hardening
- Retired all pre-production KasKold PBKDF2 compatibility readers and migration paths. KasKold-owned password protection now accepts only authenticated Argon2id formats; old `KASDB004`, `KAS\x03`, and `KSWLT003` containers fail closed. PBKDF2 remains only for standards-mandated BIP39 seed derivation (HMAC-SHA512, 2048 rounds).

### Highlights
- Refined transaction-review UX: Vault Inspect now mirrors Companion’s technical card theme with metadata, UTXO/output cards, and totals; Companion QR Frame Hex inputs now auto-validate pasted frames and accept Enter without separate acceptance buttons.
- Polished Companion transaction review with the standard teal-accent card/status treatment, consistent secondary-button hover/focus behavior, and a guaranteed signing action: ordinary unsigned PSKBs show **Send to signer**, multisig work shows **Relay to next signer**, and ready transactions show **Finalize + broadcast**.
- Fixed Companion startup presentation so the loading surface is present from the first paint and remains until a real Kaspa wRPC call succeeds; the app no longer flashes before the loader, connection copy is no longer duplicated, and failed node attempts continue retrying behind the blocking loader instead of exposing an unusable UI.
- Added an older-Android camera fallback for Companion QR scanning: live `getUserMedia` remains preferred (with legacy WebKit/Mozilla aliases), while browsers that hide/omit live camera capture—commonly Chrome on non-HTTPS local origins—can invoke the device camera through an `image/*` capture input or choose an existing QR image for local jsQR decoding.
- Added non-TTY mutation-test progress reporting for managed launchers: fresh/incremental cargo-mutants runs now print periodic completed/total percentage, elapsed time, rolling throughput, estimated remaining time, outcome counts, reuse count, and the most recently completed mutant, with the same status persisted to `target/qa/mutation/mutation-progress.log`.
- Fixed native Windows ESP32-S3 QEMU bootstrap for the observed `3221225781` (`0xC0000135`) post-extraction failure: the setup now locates or self-provisions an MSYS2 MinGW64 runtime, installs the QEMU runtime DLL packages when needed, and places `mingw64\bin` on `PATH` before ESP-IDF validates `qemu-xtensa`, preventing the otherwise-valid emulator from being deleted as unusable.
- Improved Companion amount presentation: Send fees default to KAS and use a compact alternate-unit toggle instead of verbose “view in …” text, while the dashboard balance defaults to comma-grouped KAS with two decimal places and makes the KAS/SOMPI unit itself the exact-value toggle. Transaction and balance arithmetic continue to retain canonical integer sompi internally.
- Reworked native Windows QEMU failure reporting end-to-end: the QA master runner now captures the QEMU facade itself and replays all persisted logs on failure, the PowerShell test entrypoint runs the emulator harness directly instead of nesting through another script, records a PowerShell transcript, and prints exception type/category/source position/script stack, while the shared Windows QEMU harness owns setup/build/UART execution. This guarantees a concrete diagnostic even when a managed launcher suppresses a child PowerShell stream.
- Hardened native Windows QEMU QA so Project Repo Manager can no longer collapse emulator failures to a bare exit code: the QEMU PowerShell child is byte-streamed through the Make Python facade, mirrored live, persisted to `target/qa/qemu/windows-qemu.log`, emits explicit setup/build/guest-UART stage markers, avoids PowerShell 5.1 `NativeCommandError` promotion around the Python harness, and converts the remaining Rustup installer `exit` path into a catchable error.
- Updated the CoreS3 production flash regression to follow the refactored flashing ownership boundary: `make_tasks.py` is now verified as the public dispatcher while signed-release image and `espflash write-bin` policy assertions target the canonical `make_flash.py` implementation.
- Fixed firmware flashing from captured/non-terminal launchers such as Project Repo Manager: Make now resolves an unambiguous ESP/CoreS3 serial port without an interactive picker (or requires `PORT` when multiple devices remain ambiguous), always passes the selected port explicitly to `espflash`, flashes without raw-terminal mode in the captured launcher, then opens the interactive UART monitor in a separate Windows console without resetting the freshly flashed CoreS3. Real terminals keep the integrated `espflash flash --monitor` flow. Connected hardware tests share the same serial-port selection policy.
- Fixed native Windows QEMU QA startup and diagnostics: Make now passes the exact launching Python interpreter into native wrappers (including Python 3.14/Windows Python Manager installs), the PowerShell selector recognizes Python 3.14 directly, QEMU provisioning/build/UART output is streamed instead of discarded through `Out-Null`, setup verifies that the selected emulator actually advertises the ESP32-S3 machine, and failures now report the concrete setup/test error rather than collapsing to a bare `make: *** [qa] Error 1`.
- Fixed Web Vault startup for multiple persisted wallets: the welcome screen now renders each saved wallet by name, each wallet keeps its own encrypted ciphertext/credential metadata, saving another wallet preserves the existing saved-wallet inventory, and only the wallet selected by the user is restored into the in-memory signing runtime. Existing schema-1/schema-2 browser records are migrated on read. Also fixed native Windows firmware hash convergence parsing so `make flash BOARD=m5stack` can read the generated `EXPECTED_FIRMWARE_HASH` under Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Companion dashboard polish: moved Tokens/History/Portfolio into the bottom of the Balance card, replaced the large Refresh Balance action with a compact accessible refresh icon in the card's top-right corner, and made Advanced → Broadcast Transaction return to Advanced when Back is pressed.
- Restored the Companion Web runtime function-coverage ratchet after the dashboard redesign by exercising the newly bound wallet/descriptor QR-import and transaction scanner/input handlers through the real browser event wiring; updated the Portfolio regression to the current consumer-facing "Load a wallet" error wording.
- Aligned the Companion custody-boundary regression and public documentation with the current **Multisig** startup label and Spend/Descriptor Management submenu, removing stale `Multisig / Multi-spend` terminology from consumer-facing docs and regenerated guides.
- Refined Companion wallet/network UX: changing the selected network now immediately rerenders only the saved kpubs for that network, the loaded-account action is consistently labeled **Unload kpub**, Broadcast Back/Home alignment is owned by the shared navigation row, Send/Receive are paired with directional icons, and Multisig Descriptor management can import descriptors by camera QR scan or uploaded QR image.
- Refined Companion transaction/privacy navigation: Stealth Fetch Announcements now inserts its manual-R controls safely alongside shared Back/Home navigation, the main Stealth screen again has Back/Home controls, Covenant++ categories open collapsed, Receive exposes an Advanced receive/change index selector, and loaded-wallet Multisig now opens a Spend/Descriptor Management hub with saved public descriptor reuse. Shared Back/Home controls now use an identical fixed height.
- Reconciled Companion header UI with the 14px readability floor and 50px header sizing contract, hid the saved-kpub startup prompt once selection is required, and added hover/focus feedback to both the Home logo and kaspa.stream explorer control while preserving the explorer glyph's slightly smaller visual footprint.
- Refined Companion stealth and transaction UX: stealth helper copy now flows naturally without forced line breaks, the redundant main Stealth Back/Home pair is removed, announcement fetching gives immediate busy/error feedback with null-safe event binding, testnet identity is shown as a smaller second line beneath connection status, multisig branch guidance names the KasKold signer explicitly, broadcast actions have clearer vertical spacing, and the kaspa.stream glyph is slightly smaller within its unchanged 50px click target.
- Made Linux QA dry-run/catalog inspection independent of `flock`, preserving mandatory release-workflow serialization for real executions while allowing Windows Git Bash parity tests to inspect the canonical catalog.
- Fixed the software Vault wallet-name boundary regression test so an accepted 64-byte rename remains the expected inventory value after rejected renames and wallet deletion; enlarged the Companion kaspa.stream SVG to a full 50px header visual with viewBox compensation so it matches the surrounding header icon scale.
- Refined Companion kpub management and software Vault consumer UX: empty saved-kpub lists are hidden, redundant import helper copy was removed, the kaspa.stream header link now uses the supplied SVG artwork, Vault onboarding defaults to 24 recovery words with a 12-word secondary choice, software wallet names support up to 64 UTF-8 bytes, recovery words can be shown all at once, success-status noise was removed, recovery/storage copy was simplified, About screens show the KasKold wordmark, and Web Vault menu controls share the Home-menu hover border treatment.
- Fixed the remaining native-Windows shared-QA catalog parity failures by invoking the Linux QA facade through a repository-relative POSIX path (`qa/linux/run-all.sh`) instead of passing Git Bash a `C:\...` backslash path; the shared test helpers now also surface captured stdout/stderr when the Linux facade fails.
- Consolidated the project Code of Conduct into `CONTRIBUTING.md` and removed the standalone `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and root `NOTICE` files.
- Retired the Constellation browser explorer and all of its authored assets, generators, architecture checks, and QA wiring.
- Removed the obsolete `external/hardware` reference directory and retired the root/macOS installer facades; GNU Make is now the documented public developer interface across Linux, Windows, and macOS, while platform-specific installer helpers that remain under `scripts/` are internal implementation support.
- Updated the public tagline to **Keep your KAS, safe!**, added the KasKold wordmark to the main README, and replaced pre-production warning copy with the current production-oriented self-custody disclaimer and security guidance.
- Made shared repository Python QA diagnostics durable on Windows: verbose unittest output is mirrored to stdout and `target/qa/repository-python-qa/shared.log`, failures print a concise failing-test summary plus the log path, Python runs unbuffered under the Windows catalog runner, and every failed catalog step now prints an exact `make qa RESUME_FROM=<step>` command.
- Made native Windows QA self-provision the repository-pinned ESP Rust toolchain before hardware Cargo resolution and before resumable firmware unit/build/lint stages; missing host Rust or `espup` is installed automatically using the pinned versions instead of failing on `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- Fixed native Windows strict QA bootstrap so the pinned branch-coverage setup also provisions Node.js LTS with winget when `node` is missing, refreshes the current process PATH, and verifies the runtime before browser coverage starts.
- Standardized Companion header controls to a 50px visual height while keeping external-link glyphs at a balanced 32px inside those controls, enlarged online status/dot indicators, replaced the labeled watch-only divider with a single rule, added spacing between startup tools, raised all shared Companion microcopy to a 14px minimum across Web/Android/iOS, simplified kpub-entry helper copy/placeholders, and restyled Back to match the shared Home control.
- Retired the Companion donation popup and donation-specific assets/configuration; the header logo is now a Home control.
- Hardened Companion Web deployment cache coherence: deployable CSS, JavaScript, images, libraries, and every relative ES-module edge now share a deterministic content revision, preventing stale browser modules from being mixed with regenerated HTML. Optional settings/wallet event targets are null-safe so removed controls cannot abort sibling bindings.
- Removed the duplicate **Wallet → Recovery → Multisig Descriptor** entry. Multisig descriptor restore is now owned exclusively by **Wallet → Multisig → Descriptors → Restore from SD**, with view / backup / restore / delete management remaining there.
- Mirrored the authoritative hardware multisig descriptor navigation into Vault Web and the mobile Vault menus. Web Vault now stores public descriptor records by the active wallet multisig kpub, prompts before saving newly created/imported descriptors, and scopes view/backup/delete listings to the active wallet.
- Removed the retired BIP39 last-word calculator implementation/export from `offline-signer`. The six missed crypto mutants from the completed mutation run all targeted that dead calculator path (`complete_last_word_24`, `write_word_bits`, and `checksum_matches`), so those mutation sites no longer exist in the production crypto surface. BIP39 mnemonic generation/validation and standards-required PBKDF2 seed derivation remain unchanged.
- Fixed the hardware home grid so the **Scan QR**, **Wallet**, and **Settings** card icons use pure-black transparent backgrounds on the black cards, restored the dedicated Settings artwork on the home tile, and kept the Connect companion card on the original companion artwork path.
- Shortened the Connect watch-only export header to **COMPANION QR** so the title no longer clips on the device top rail.
- Completed the hardware multisig descriptor-management flow: newly created multisig descriptors prompt for immediate save, saved descriptors persist into device storage, and Wallet → Multisig now exposes a **Descriptors** menu for view / backup-to-SD / restore-from-SD / delete management. Descriptor listings remain filtered so only descriptors involving the currently open mnemonic wallet are shown.
- Reorganized Wallet backup/recovery navigation so **Backup** and **Recovery** are direct Wallet menu entries. Backup owns mnemonic/SeedQR/SD and advanced export methods; Recovery owns restore/import methods. Successful SD backups return to the menu that launched them.
- Restored wallets now begin with an explicit **Words / SeedQR / SD / Advanced** source picker. Mnemonic restores follow **source -> optional BIP39 passphrase -> wallet name -> Save Securely / Session Only**; XPrv/raw-key restores skip the inapplicable BIP39 step and use the same final storage choice. Session-only wallets remain non-serialized.
- Removed redundant recovery-word redisplay after mnemonic import and hardened navigation ownership/Back transitions so restore completion does not fall into `UI-NAV-01`.
- Replaced parallel Add Wallet booleans with an explicit `PendingAddWalletKind` state to keep the firmware within the strict Clippy boolean-structure policy.
- Fixed multisig review so proven P2SH change is excluded from the displayed send amount, while the hardware independently verifies descriptor-backed ownership before classifying change.
- Fixed multisig standard-fee planning and finalization for the signed transaction shape, including KIP-9 storage mass and threshold signature-script mass, so standardness fees match node requirements.
- Preserved exact partially signed KSPT relay payloads between hardware cosigners and corrected partial/complete status handling for M-of-N signing.
- Fixed testnet multisig branch discovery, next receive/change derivation, descriptor Back routing, and zero-balance guidance.
- Refactored the PSKT consensus-finalization boundary into smaller helpers while preserving owned-value semantics, consensus output construction, persistent-vault binding, and KIP-9 calculations.
- Qualified the iOS application path on macOS/Xcode; remaining meaningful hardware qualification gaps are non-CoreS3 ESP32-S3 variants.
- Kept the canonical production E2E requirements and versionless production-surface ratchet aligned with the current Wallet/Backup/Recovery UI.
- Added optional CoreS3 owner-authorized application firmware: an RSA-3072 owner key may be enrolled before Pop It! alongside the official Secure Boot authority, development builds simulate irreversible actions without eFuse writes, and owner-signed applications are verified by the vendor bootloader against the dedicated owner digest plus hardware anti-rollback before OTA selection.
- Separated normal production firmware from the destructive CoreS3 provisioning profile: `make release` omits Pop It!/owner-authority UI and boot-control staging, the dedicated secure-provisioning bootloader defers flash-encryption/Secure-Boot/anti-rollback eFuse transitions until explicit Pop It consent, and `make flash-release` flashes only an existing checksum-verified signed merged normal-release image without rebuilding, provisioning, or unsigned fallback.
- Restored the original owner-only CoreS3 Secure Boot policy as the distinct `secure-owner-only` profile: the owner RSA-3072 key signs the special boot chain, is enrolled as the sole live Secure Boot digest (slot 0), unused digest slots are revoked, Pop It cannot proceed without owner enrollment, and no vendor hardware signing authority remains trusted.
- Kept development/workflow-test firmware aligned with the provisioning UI feature split and added resumable full QA through `make qa RESUME_FROM=<stable-step-id>`, which reruns the named failed step and every later canonical QA stage.


A major architecture, security, and integration release. KasSigner 2.0 keeps the
hardware signer air-gapped while separating protocol, signing, firmware, watcher,
and host-integration responsibilities into reviewable crates. The release also
turns KasSee into a shared Rust/WASM runtime used by the browser and mobile
shells, adds a supported wallet-integration SDK, introduces optional encrypted
on-device wallet persistence, and substantially expands automated assurance.

### Added
- **Direct wallet integration SDK.** `kassigner-sdk` provides the supported
  network-free pair/prepare/complete/finalize flow for third-party wallets, while
  `kassigner-protocol` exposes lower-level PSKT/KSPT/QR primitives. Wallets pair
  directly with the hardware; KasSee is the reference consumer rather than an
  intermediary.
- **Optional encrypted wallet persistence.** Hardware users can choose
  **Always Start Fresh** for RAM-only operation or opt into device-bound encrypted
  wallet storage protected by the ESP32-S3 HMAC eFuse service plus the user's
  credential. Portable recovery remains the BIP39 mnemonic plus optional
  passphrase.
- **Expanded wallet model.** Up to 16 active slots can hold BIP39 mnemonic
  wallets, account XPrv wallets, or raw secp256k1 private keys, with explicit
  wallet selection, protection, activation, deletion, and recovery flows.
- **Shared KasSee runtime across browser and mobile.** KasSee Web remains the
  watch-only reference wallet; Android and iOS shells host the same Rust/WASM
  runtime with platform-native integration rather than independent wallet logic.
- **Session-bound KSPT v4 and standard PSKT interoperability.** Compact KSPT
  carries KasSigner-specific framing/network context, while standard PSKT remains
  ecosystem-compatible and does not gain a KasSigner network field. QR and SD
  signing share the canonical parser/signing path.
- **Richer transaction review.** Compact confirmation is the default, with an
  optional detailed review path for inputs, outputs, fees, ownership/change,
  lock time, multisig, covenants, stealth, and other supported transaction
  metadata before signing.
- **Broader hardware and runtime qualification.** ESP32-S3 QEMU vectors,
  connected-device workflow E2E, physical HIL tranches, browser real-node and
  funded-testnet flows, Android tests, fuzzing, mutation testing, coverage/CRAP,
  and reproducible-build evidence are integrated into the QA system.

### Changed
- **Repository architecture.** Security-sensitive logic is split into
  `offline-signer`, `shared-signer`, `signer-firmware-core`,
  `kassigner-protocol`, and related focused crates instead of accumulating in one
  firmware/application surface. Host/watch-only code cannot depend upward into
  private-key ownership.
- **KasSee transaction and node layers.** Amounts that participate in signing
  stay integer-safe end to end, public-node discovery follows the official Kaspa
  resolver pool and browser TLS policy, WebSocket lifecycles are bounded, and
  transaction construction/broadcast use the same stable WASM facade consumed by
  integration tests.
- **Entropy and key lifecycle.** Seed generation combines mandatory
  health-checked hardware RNG and camera entropy with additional board/timing
  context; signing, encryption, and seed creation fail closed when required
  entropy or key state is unavailable. Secret-bearing session state is wiped at
  ownership boundaries and on abandonment paths.
- **Firmware navigation and long-running work.** UI state ownership is explicit,
  blocking operations are supervised with liveness budgets, camera/SD resources
  have single owners, and firmware update now presents USB update guidance rather
  than reusing the transaction QR scanner.
- **Error presentation.** Device errors wrap by rendered pixel width over
  multiple lines instead of truncating by character count, preserving complete
  actionable messages on the 320x240 displays.
- **Build entrypoints.** GNU Make is the stable Linux/Windows/macOS contributor
  interface. Toolchains, Gradle, WASM generation, firmware builds, release
  packaging, and source-archive construction are pinned or verified and fail
  closed when required dependencies are missing.

### Fixed
- **Fuzz evidence ZIP timestamp hardening.** Fuzz-result archiving now writes deterministic ZIP metadata instead of inheriting filesystem mtimes, so extracted or synthetic files dated before 1980 cannot crash `make qa`.
- **CoreS3 PIN/password key audio feedback.** Credential-cue resume is now idempotent, so ordinary queued key-click feedback is no longer discarded on non-credential frames and continues to obey the persisted global mute/volume policy.
- **Initial WALLETS navigation chrome.** The WALLETS screen hides Back while startup wallet resolution has no active wallet, matching the existing fail-closed Back-navigation guard.
- **Offline signer warning hygiene.** `MAX_REDEEM_SIZE` is imported only by the KSPT wire-adapter unit tests that exercise the redeem boundary, keeping the production library warning-free without weakening the test.
- **Mutation boundary regressions.** Added exact boundary/oracle coverage identified by full-repository mutation testing: HD45 sorting verifies depth and child-number metadata move with encoded participants, current backup framing pins the exact header-plus-tag short-input boundary, and covenant dust folding preserves change at the KIP-9 minimum.
- **PSKT output derivation mutation baseline.** Corrected the output `bip32Derivations` mutation fixture to use the canonical keyed-object grammar, preserving MS45 hint coverage while allowing the unmutated `offline-signer` baseline to execute.
- **Mutation baseline compilation.** Corrected the survivor-regression tests so the fresh repository mutation baseline compiles: the crowdfunding WASM test now imports the intended bounded-hex helper from its contracts module, and the oracle heartbeat-empty assertion no longer requires `UtxoEntry: PartialEq`.
- **Mutation-test hardening.** Added targeted coverage for viable Rust mutation gaps identified across multisig descriptor parsing, encrypted-container framing, KSPT/PSKT boundaries, signed-KSPT threshold handling, transaction builders, covenant/shipping/vault/oracle/ZK paths, and exact amount/count limits. Equivalent/no-progress mutation sites were rewritten into checked or typed operations, and targeted boundary/round-trip tests distinguish the intended semantics without mutation exclusions.
- **iOS/macOS application qualification.** Qualified the iOS shell on macOS/Xcode with simulator-tested shared KasSee rendering, loopback HTTP framing/load-health checks, native App Lock test seams, weather-cover behavior fixes, XCTest/XCUITest coverage, and the focused iOS mutation campaign that killed all 85 discovered native-shell mutants. Added the iOS-only `scripts/mac/` setup/build/run entrypoints and native Make dispatch while keeping generated KasSee runtime output under `target/`.
- **Connected Receive E2E reachability.** Restored the implemented Receive address-control journey as an authoritative connected-device tranche, routes it through the production Home -> Wallet -> Receive controllers, and keeps host/Rust tranche registries synchronized so required runtime markers cannot remain orphaned behind unreachable harness code. Existing tranche numbers 1-10 remain stable; Receive is tranche 11.
- **Connected-device operation lifecycle parity.** The physical workflow E2E Connect KasSee probe now renders the queued loading surface exactly once and advances `Presented -> Running` through the same authoritative operation transition used by production before driving the real cooperative kpub derivation. This prevents the HIL harness from falsely tripping `OP-ORDER-01` by replaying the one-shot loading-render boundary.
- **Android mutation-test liveness.** App-lock coroutine tests now prove that authentication actually enters an in-flight state without waiting indefinitely for a callback that a mutant can suppress. Mutant-specific process timeouts after a green baseline are classified as killed mutants, allowing the full mutation campaign to continue while preserving the 100% score requirement.
- **Standard PSKT review/signing.** Standard PSKT no longer passes through the
  compact-KSPT network-trailer check. The selected wallet network is bound only
  to the in-memory review/signing context, leaving the PSKT wire format unchanged.
- **KasSee signed-PSKT completion.** Browser and funded-testnet flows use the
  supported SDK completion boundary and consume the serialized `psktHex` result,
  avoiding stale low-level WASM facade calls or field names.
- **Public-node integration.** HTTP/loopback clients request the resolver's
  `any` class while HTTPS clients request `tls` and require `wss://`; resolver
  exhaustion now reports the individual resolver failures rather than only a
  generic connectivity error.
- **Wallet-list workflow parity.** Connected-device wallet inventory tests and
  navigation now match the production ordering where **Add Wallet** precedes
  loaded wallet rows, preserving explicit activation semantics after deletion.
- **Android build and mutation qualification.** API-37 SDK and pinned Gradle
  discovery work from project/cache locations without requiring global Kotlin
  CLI tools. Generated KasSee assets participate in the real Gradle dependency
  graph so unit tests and mutation runs cannot consume their output before the
  sync task completes. Weather validation/cache behavior and the native app-lock
  lifecycle now have deterministic Robolectric coverage, including exact lock
  delay boundaries, concurrent/cancelled authentication, and privacy-cover state.
- **QEMU and hardware workflow parity.** Transaction touch vectors, firmware
  update/runtime probes, scanner ownership, connected reset isolation, and
  failure replay now track the same production controller semantics used on the
  device.

### Security
- **Fail-closed parser and signing boundaries.** Parsers enforce declared counts,
  framing/length limits, full-consumption rules, monetary bounds, ownership and
  derivation constraints before signing-sensitive state is reached.
- **Anti-klepto and transaction identity checks** are integrated into the
  supported signing flow, with transaction/reveal mismatches rejected rather
  than silently accepted.
- **Device-bound persistence does not replace mnemonic recovery.** The eFuse/HMAC
  binding protects local encrypted state; the mnemonic plus optional BIP39
  passphrase remains the durable cross-device recovery material.
- **Production architecture gates** prevent debug/measurement features, generated
  artifacts, host private-key access, and dependency inversions from entering
  release builds.
- **Release assurance** includes pinned toolchains, source inventory checks,
  deterministic flat archives, reproducible builds, signed release evidence,
  mutation/fuzz campaigns, critical-domain coverage thresholds, complexity/CRAP
  checks, and connected hardware/runtime qualification.

### Developer and test-suite cleanup
- Consolidated the Python regression suite
  into domain-oriented tests. Behavioral/security regressions remain, while
  duplicate source-shape locks, temporary build-metadata checks, and tests-of-tests are
  removed so the permanent suite describes product invariants rather than the
  implementation history of the refactor.
- Canonical architecture, feature-parity, fuzz, mutation, release, browser,
  mobile, QEMU, connected-device, and funded/real-node gates remain first-class
  QA entrypoints.

### Compatibility and validation notes
- All first-party crates/packages in this release are versioned **2.0.0**.
- Standard PSKT interoperability is preserved; KasSigner-specific network/session
  metadata remains in KSPT rather than extending PSKT.
- The 2.0.0 line has been hardware-tested on M5Stack CoreS3 and exercised
  through KasSee Web, Android, and the iOS app on macOS Sonoma with Xcode 16.2
  using an iPhone 16 Pro Simulator. iOS is therefore no longer a meaningful
  unresolved application-qualification gap. Waveshare boards and other ESP32-S3
  hardware variants remain unverified until independently tested; signed iOS
  Release plus physical-device smoke remains formal release evidence.
- The maintained hardware signer runs on consumer ESP32-S3 hardware; automated
  assurance complements independent review, physical attack testing, entropy
  characterization, and accumulated field evidence.

## [1.0.7]: 2026-08-27

An **auditability** release. The security-critical half of the firmware moves
into a separate crate that builds and tests on any host, so a reviewer needs no
hardware and no Xtensa toolchain to run the same known-answer tests the device
runs at boot. The parsers were then held against the rusty-kaspa 2.0.1
reference implementation and its own fixtures, which surfaced and closed a
real signing gap, and a defect in the release pipeline that had made the
published unsigned hashes meaningless was found and fixed.

### Added
- **`core/`, the `kassigner-core` crate**: key derivation, mnemonics, the
  transaction parsers and serializers, sighash, Schnorr, storage encryption
  and the FAT32 layer, as a `no_std` crate with no peripheral access.
  `cd core && cargo test`, 58 tests; the crate carries its own
  `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning 1.85.0, the host compiler the release build
  uses, and rustup fetches it on first run. The firmware
  consumes it as a path dependency and re-exports the old paths, so no call
  site changed. The two things it needs from hardware arrive through
  registration points that fail closed: no logger registered means nothing
  prints, and no entropy source registered means **no signature is produced**.
- **Fuzzing**: nine parser fuzz targets with one total function per parser,
  run three ways: a deterministic mutation smoke loop under plain
  `cargo test`, a cargo-fuzz project over the same bodies for coverage-guided
  runs, and CI on every push (`.github/workflows/core.yml`).
- **Vectors from the reference implementation**: the boot sighash set grows
  from 27 to 30, Bitcoin-versioned `xprv`/`xpub` are refused by all six import
  entry points, and the 45' multisig KAT reproduces the Go implementation's
  address. The V8 and V9 multisig hint vectors are now host tests, with a
  cross-format check that KSPT v4 and PSKB agree on every signed field and
  hint.
- **Lock time on the review screens**: a timelocked transaction shows
  "Locked until DAA n" or "Locked until YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC" in orange on
  TX REVIEW, and a LOCKED marker on CONFIRM SEND. Zero lock time draws
  nothing, so existing screens are pixel-identical. The device discloses; it
  does not refuse.
- **The release build tests itself**: the Docker build now runs the core host
  tests before building any image, so a failing vector stops the release
  instead of shipping.

### Changed
- **One SD layer**: the two per-board FAT32 copies collapse into
  `core/fat32.rs` over a `BlockDevice` trait, keeping the stricter guard from
  each, and host-tested against an in-memory card image. FAT writes are
  batched per sector rather than per cluster (a 7-cluster file costs 2 writes,
  not 26), ordered so a power loss leaks clusters rather than leaving a live
  entry over reusable ones. Waveshare reuses a held card via CMD13+CMD7
  instead of re-initialising.
- **Camera lifecycle in one place**: the camera-state sets are defined once,
  the touch debounce lives on `AppData`, and every one of the 28 camera exit
  paths arms it at the exit: 25 through `leave_camera`, and three where
  `start_review` sets the next state itself and the exit arms the guard
  directly, each with a comment saying so. The Waveshare scan-exit
  freeze was the path the old per-board cleanup missed.
- **PSKB compatibility, on both sides of the QR**: an unset `sequence` signs
  as `u64::MAX` as the rusty-kaspa signer hashes it, an explicit value is
  signed as given, the lock time is the largest `minTime` across the inputs,
  and creator-role zero counts over populated arrays are read as unset.
  rusty-kaspa's own committed fixture now parses. KasSee follows the same
  rules, and gains a reachable paste and copy-hex control and an "already
  accepted" broadcast reply treated as the success it is.

### Fixed
- **Published unsigned hashes now stand for the real firmware.**
  `FIRMWARE_SIGNED` was a `const bool`, so with `false` the compiler could
  prove boot never reached the wallet and delete it: 244-271 kB stubs against
  904-912 kB signed, and a verifier rebuilding unsigned reproduced the stub.
  The flag is now read through `core::ptr::read_volatile`, a guarantee where a
  hint is not, and the release build refuses to ship an unsigned image that is
  not full-sized and within 64 KiB of its signed pair. Compare unsigned
  against unsigned.
- **The device could not sign a timelocked transaction, in either
  direction.** `minTime` was skipped on parse, so the device signed lock time
  0 while the sender's extractor built the requested value. The emitter had
  the same gap in mirror, writing `"minTime":null` on every input, so a
  returned bundle reconstructed to lock time 0 and a second multisig signer
  saw no lock time at all. Fail closed both ways, no funds at risk, but the
  capability did not exist. Both fixed, with a roundtrip test that pins it.
  KSPT was never affected.
- **An absent PSKB sequence signed as 0**, producing signatures reference
  wallets reject. Now `u64::MAX`, per the rules above.
- **A test in `ecies.rs` had never compiled**; the `cfg(test)` code was
  unbuildable before the crate split made it buildable, and the assertion is
  fixed.
- **A scanned transaction could halt the device.** Values were never bounded
  at parse time, so two outputs near `u64::MAX` overflowed the review sums and
  trapped before anything was signed. Both parsers now check each value and
  the running total against the consensus `MAX_SOMPI`. (a)
- **A covenant backup could be written corrupt**: the hex decode validated
  only the first eight characters, so garbage was saved and the failure would
  have surfaced at restore. (a)
- **The formatter declared space the FAT could not address**, 7.5 GiB behind a
  FAT covering about 4 GiB, and left a previous filesystem's chains live past
  sector 32. Geometry now comes from the card's CSD, both FATs are cleared,
  and every format write is read back. Cards formatted by 1.0.6 keep working;
  formatting a large card takes longer. (a)
- **Further hardening from the same passes**: a failed delete no longer passes
  silently before a same-name create; a duplicate derivation hint is refused;
  a seed backup word index outside the wordlist is refused; a third multisig
  config in one session is registered rather than dropped; an over-range
  redeem script is refused rather than truncated; the signing slot is claimed
  only once a mnemonic is present; the SD helpers bounds-check the caller's
  buffer; the Waveshare viewfinder repaints on the first back tap; and in
  KasSee the values that reach a signature are BigInt end to end. (a)

### Removed
- **`Install.sh`.** It downloaded the latest release over curl and flashed it
  with no checksum, no signature and no tag pin, on devices that at that
  point have no Secure Boot burned. That contradicted everything the
  reproducible-build design stands for. Build from source or flash a release
  binary whose hash you verified.
- **The single-PSKT envelope**, dead on both ends: nothing anywhere emits it
  and rusty-kaspa's own branch for it is `unimplemented!`.
- **Every GPIO edge-counting camera probe.** They aliased: a working camera
  read as a dead clock and vice versa. The real proof of a live camera is a
  full DMA frame and a decode, and the code now says so where the probes
  were.
- **The dead M5 SPI2 debug stub**, a 1 MHz path that was never wired in. The
  schematic shows the M5 socket is 1-bit SPI on the shared display bus, so
  the imagined fast path does not exist on this hardware.

### Security
- **Signing fails closed without entropy**: with no hardware source
  registered, `schnorr_sign` returns an error and produces no signature,
  pinned by a host test, rather than ever signing with a predictable nonce.
- **The signing keypair is written `0600`** by `gen-keypair` instead of the
  platform default.
- The build scripts pass the build configuration through verbatim and print
  which signing key, if any, they found; the embedded hash is read from the
  generated file rather than parsed out of logs.
- **Scratch buffers are cleared on every path, including the failures.** A
  caller cannot reach a callee's frame, so `base58check_decode` left a decoded
  xprv, private key included, in its own scratch; `import_xprv` the same. The
  session wipe now also covers the message being signed, the commit-reveal
  buffers that hold it on the heap, and the last parsed transaction. (a)

(a) Reported by [KodinglsFun](https://x.com/KodinglsFun); fixed in PRs #14
and #15.

### Known limitations
- A byte-diff of a signed image against an unsigned one is not confined to
  the signature region: the differing constants shift the compiler's output
  broadly. This is why verification compares unsigned against unsigned; a
  build where the code segments are byte-identical is on the roadmap.
- The lock-time screens disclose; they do not gate. A signer who ignores the
  orange text signs the lock time as given.

## [1.0.6]: 2026-08-18

A **multisig and hardening** release. Multisig moves to the Kaspa 45' scheme,
proven end to end on mainnet between two devices. Several security reviews of
v1.0.5 were answered: every finding was checked against the source and either
fixed, disputed with evidence, or declined with the reasoning recorded. What
shipped is below.

### Added
- **45' multisig**: cosigners derive at `m/45'/111111'/0'/<cosigner>/<chain>/<index>`,
  keys sorted so every implementation computes the same address, chain 1 for
  change. Create on device from scanned cosigner kpubs, co-sign between devices
  by QR, spend from several addresses in one transaction. The scheme is written
  up in [KIP: Multisig Wallet Conventions for Kaspa](https://github.com/kaspanet/kips/pull/39).
  Existing 44' wallets still load and spend; new wallets are 45' only.
- **Multisig change verification**: when a transaction claims an output as
  change, the device tries to reproduce it from a loaded descriptor that already
  reproduces one of the inputs. Verified is teal, unverifiable is orange with a
  `?`, and a claim the descriptor contradicts is marked FORGED and refused.
- **Descriptor backup**: the multisig descriptor is shown as a QR and can be
  saved to SD, plain or encrypted. A seed alone cannot find or spend multisig
  funds; back up seed and descriptor.
- **Multisig kpub export**: a separate, labelled `kpub Multisig QR` exports the
  45' key. The 44' export stays as the watch-only key. The two are
  byte-indistinguishable in form, so the label is the only distinction.
- **KSPT v4**: derivation hints ride the transaction so a device signs a
  multisig input without scanning its address table. Chosen by content: a
  single-sig transaction is byte-identical to before, and older firmware refuses
  the new version cleanly rather than reporting a corrupt scan.
- **Consensus sighash tests at every boot**: 27 vectors taken from the
  rusty-kaspa 2.0.1 consensus tests, all six sighash types and both transaction
  versions, run before the menu on every power-on and halt the device on
  divergence. See Fixed below for why this matters.
- **Secure Boot state on the verification screen**: five read-only eFuse bits
  shown so a user can see whether the unit is provisioned. (a)
- **KasSee multisig**: import a 45' descriptor, watch the wallet, pick UTXOs
  across addresses, consolidate, relay between cosigners, broadcast.
- **KasSee network layer reworked**: the public node is held for the session,
  failing resolvers are remembered and skipped, the WebSocket is pooled, a
  timeout drops the socket instead of counting as success, and history scans run
  spaced instead of all at once. Wallet load went from minutes to seconds on a
  wallet with deep history and the CORS noise is gone.

### Fixed
- **The sighash self-tests had never executed in any build.** They halted on
  the stack guard before reaching the test and nothing reported it. Moved to the
  heap, promoted into the boot known-answer set, and measured 27/27 on hardware.
- **Covenant binding validation**: a malformed `covenantId` could leave the
  field zeroed with the binding still active, or carry an attacker-chosen prefix.
  Both members are now required, range and duplicate checked, and a decode error
  rejects the transaction rather than warning. (a)
- **`covenantId` was dropped from the round trip** and covenant outputs lost
  their binding when re-emitted. Both restored.
- **Covenant spends were under-paying fees** and would have been rejected at
  broadcast; fee floor corrected, proven on mainnet.
- **PSKB round trip**: the device accepted more inputs than it could return.
  Emit buffer raised, a pre-flight check before any key operation, capacity from
  5 inputs to 9. SD transaction files were capped at 1,024 bytes in three places;
  the encrypted KSPT round trip could not complete; the emitted frame count could
  wrap above 255. All fixed, and a QR density that will not fit is greyed out
  with the reason shown.
- **Parser hardening**: declared counts are now checked, `{` and `[` are
  tracked separately with a depth ceiling, all duplicate keys are guarded, and
  both binary parsers require the buffer to be fully consumed. (a)
- **SD reads**: a short FAT chain and a circular FAT chain are now both
  detected and named on screen instead of returning a truncated file as success. (a)
- **KasSee amounts** above 2^53 sompi lost precision in `Number()`; all spend
  paths now use BigInt. (a)
- **QR decoder bounds**: three grid bounds added after host fuzzing of
  `rqrr_nostd`, one reachable at real capture geometry. Decode rates unchanged.
- **Multi-frame QR limit** raised from 40 to 64 frames, matched between KasSee
  and firmware. (a)
- **Multisig signing was doing hundreds of derivations per input**: the hinted
  key was derived once per input and once per cosigner position. Hoisted; signing
  is now effectively independent of N.
- **A created 45' wallet did not sort its cosigners** and produced an address no
  other implementation computes; the kpub export still emitted 44' after
  creation moved to 45'; the output serializer stripped every output's
  derivation map; a multisig transaction matching no key still emitted a
  signature. All fixed and verified on two devices.
- **The descriptor QR was drawn under signed-transaction overlays.**
- **The camera XCLK check reported a dead clock on a working device.**

### Security
- Several security reviews of v1.0.5 answered in full. Every claim was verified
  against the code before anything changed; several were refuted from source.
  What was fixed is in this entry; the reasoning behind what was declined is in
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Backup KDF stays at PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 100,000 rounds, by decision.** A
  six-fold increase buys under three bits against rented GPUs; the salt and the
  password are where the security is. The container reserves a KDF id for a
  memory-hard replacement.
- **Integer overflow checks** now enabled on the KasSee release profile. (a)
- **Measurement features cannot reach a shipped build**: every diagnostic flag
  is a compile error together with `production`.
- **Hardware RNG min-entropy measured for the first time** (SP 800-90B, offline)
  and health checks enforced on every draw: a degraded window refuses to sign,
  encrypt or generate a salt.

(a) Reported by [KodinglsFun](https://x.com/KodinglsFun) in a review of v1.0.5.

### Known limitations
- A 45' PSKB from an external coordinator that carries no derivation hints
  cannot yet be signed; KasSee always writes them, so this affects other
  coordinators only.
- Multi-frame QR transfers still carry no session identifier. Every mixed
  assembly we can construct fails the parse, so the practical effect is a
  failed scan, but universal rejection is not proven; the device review
  screen remains the control on what is signed.
- The multisig descriptor is a second secret with the same backup requirement as
  the seed. Losing it loses access to the funds.

## [1.0.5]: 2026-08-03

A **security and hardening** release. A full security review of the codebase
was answered; this release closes most of what it found. It also adds a second
way to hide a seed backup inside a photograph, and fixes three defects that made
the existing one identifiable.

Two of the findings date from the start of the project and are described in the
Security section below.

### Added
- **Picture carrier for seed backups**: a second way to hide an encrypted seed in
  a JPEG, this time in the image's own compressed data rather than in its metadata.
  Choose at export:
  - **Descriptor** (the existing carrier) survives re-saving the photo, and is
    destroyed if anything strips metadata, which messaging apps and most social
    platforms do routinely.
  - **Picture** (new) ignores metadata stripping entirely, and is destroyed if the
    photo is re-compressed.
- **EXIF template for photos with no metadata**: screenshots and messaging-app
  downloads have no EXIF at all. Rather than leaving a two-tag block that no camera
  would produce, the device now synthesises a plausible software-export profile.
  It deliberately claims no camera make or model, because a fabricated camera
  identity can be contradicted by the photo's own compression parameters.
- **Camera and QR scanning reworked**: many rounds of work on the capture and
  decode path, alongside a hardware change on the Waveshare board. The visible
  result is a smoother viewfinder: capture, display and decoding used to share a
  single CPU core, so the preview froze for the length of every decode attempt.
  The ESP32-S3's second core was sitting idle, and decoding now runs there, so
  the image keeps moving while a scan is in progress.
- **Structural entropy health tests**: the hardware RNG is now checked for
  *structure*, not only for being stuck. A free-running counter, a stuck half-word
  and a stuck register are all refused. Boot logs report `stuck n/32 mono false`.

### Fixed
- **Steganography artifacts were identifiable three ways**: an audit hid one
  backup among 200 photographs and found it every time, with no false positives:
  a fixed text string at the head of every artifact, an EXIF tag count no camera
  produces, and a segment order no encoder writes. All three are closed and the
  same test now finds nothing. The photo's own camera metadata. Make, model, date,
  thumbnail. Is preserved intact rather than discarded.
- **Re-exporting onto the same photo left the previous encrypted seed in the file.**

### Security
- **The hardware random number generator had never been read.** It was addressed at
  the wrong location for this chip and returned zeros on every device since the
  project started. Found by measurement, not by inspection.

  **This does not mean seeds from earlier versions rested on nothing.** Seed
  generation mixes eight camera captures into the entropy pool, and the camera
  carried it while the RNG contributed nothing. But the per-pixel health checks
  that verify those captures actually varied shipped in this release, not before:
  on 1.0.0 through 1.0.4 the camera check was satisfied by the capture buffer
  pointer being non-null and never tested the data. So for those releases the
  camera contribution is unverified rather than absent, and users holding
  significant funds on an automatically generated seed from that era should
  consider migrating. It is rated Critical because a redundant source silently
  returning zeros for the life of a project is exactly the failure that must
  never go undetected.
- **Releases 1.0.0 through 1.0.4 carry signatures that cannot be verified.** The
  signing tool computed the challenge incorrectly, so no BIP-340 verifier accepts
  them. **This affects only the check that a downloaded firmware file is authentic.**
  It never touched transaction signing, key derivation or funds. Those use a
  separate, correct code path, and every release signed transactions normally.
  Both sides are now anchored to a published test vector, checked at every boot.
- **Radio lockdown was not doing what it claimed.** It wrote to the wrong register,
  so the WiFi/Bluetooth power domain stayed energised from reset, and on M5Stack
  neither lockdown phase ran at all. **Nothing was transmitted:** the firmware
  contains no network stack, no drivers and no radio initialisation, so there is
  nothing on the device capable of using those radios. The defect left a powered
  peripheral where the design called for an unpowered one. Defence in depth that
  was not actually in place. Rather than an open radio.
- **Verification codes widened from 4 bytes to 8.** The firmware attestation and
  the transaction payload code are compared by a human against another screen.
  32 bits can be brute-forced by the very attacker they exist to catch; 64 cannot.
- **Constant-time key derivation**: BIP32 child-key comparison and reduction no
  longer branch on secret values.
- **Anti-glitch counter now detects order, not just count**: the previous version
  could be satisfied by skipping one stage and gaining another elsewhere.
- **Entropy failures refuse to sign** rather than silently falling back to a
  deterministic nonce.
- **Secrets wiped on drop** for mnemonics and extended public keys.
- **KasSee no longer publishes wallet state on `window`**: the derived addresses,
  UTXO set and pending transaction are no longer reachable by page scripts.

### Known limitations
- Backup password stretching is still PBKDF2. A memory-hard replacement is
  designed but deferred, so a weak backup password can be attacked offline.
  Use a strong one, and a strong passphrase.
- Multi-frame QR transfers still carry no session identifier. Every mixed
  assembly we can construct fails the parse, so the practical effect is a
  failed scan, but universal rejection is not proven; the device review
  screen remains the control on what is signed.

## [1.0.4]: 2026-07-02

The **Covenants++ (cov++)** release. KasSee builds covenant transactions; KasSigner
reviews and signs them air-gapped; KasSee broadcasts. The same
unsigned-build → sign-offline → broadcast flow, now for programmable covenants on
**Kaspa Toccata** (script introspection, `OP_CAT`, `OP_ZK_PRECOMPILE`). Exercised on
the TN10 test network.

### Added
- **Covenant suite (KasSee)**: build, fund, and spend a family of on-chain covenants:
  - **Piggy Bank**: save toward a goal or deadline; break it open to withdraw.
  - **Time-Locked Savings**: lock funds until a date; no early access, not even by you.
  - **Dead Man's Switch**: heir inherits after inactivity; a heartbeat resets the timer.
  - **Allowance**: a beneficiary withdraws up to a cap, with a cooldown between withdrawals.
  - **Spending Limit**: a per-withdrawal cap with cooldown, across the whole balance.
  - **Merkle Whitelist**: spend only to an approved set, proven with a Merkle proof (`OP_CAT`).
  - **Direct Channel**: payment channel with arbiter dispute resolution.
  - **Oracle**: release on an oracle attestation.
  - **PayJoin**: anonymous payment covenant.
  - **Commit-Reveal**: MEV-resistant inscriptions.
  - **Private Swap**: atomic swap via adaptor signatures: no preimage, no on-chain link.
- **ZK Price Oracle (KasSee)**: live KAS/USD sourced from Pyth + Wormhole and proven on-chain with a zero-knowledge proof; ambient read plus pay-to-refresh.
- **Stealth payments (KasSee)**: dual-key stealth addresses (ECDH with view tags) so anyone can pay you without linking payments to your public address; send, scan, and an optional stealth indexer for recovery.
- **Covenant-aware PSKB signing (KasSigner)**: the KSPT format gains v3 (u16 redeem length for larger covenant scripts) and a covenant-binding flag (`0x04`): outputs carry a `covenant_id` and auth-input index, parsed and preserved through the sign round-trip. The signer recognizes the P2SH covenant redeem scripts and signs the matching input.
- **On-device covenant review (KasSigner)**: a transaction spending a covenant P2SH is labelled as such on the confirm screen, and every output is shown with its amount and its bech32 destination. Before any of that, the redeem script supplied by the host is checked to hash to the P2SH commitment in the UTXO being spent, and an input whose script does not match is reported as unrecognised and left unsigned. The device does not decode covenant parameters such as recipient, cap, timelock or heir.
- **ECIES (KasSigner, `wallet/ecies.rs`)**: encrypt-to-pubkey / decrypt-with-key via ECDH + BLAKE2B-256 + AES-256-GCM (33-byte ephemeral pubkey, 12-byte nonce, AEAD tag), for stealth / recovery payloads.

### Changed
- **KasSee WASM refactor**: split `lib.rs` (7291 → ~1,190 lines) and `kspt.rs` into per-feature modules (adaptor / stealth / oracle-mb / vault / covenant / zk, plus the `kspt_*` covenant-builder modules). All `wasm-bindgen` export names and behaviour unchanged.
- **KasSee tooling**: crate/module documentation, `rustfmt.toml`, a CI workflow, and SPDX / repository Cargo metadata; kassee crate version aligned to 1.0.4.

## [1.0.3]: 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Menu & Export restructure**: Tools reorganized into Seed Tools / Import-Export / Single Signature / Multisig; Export into Seed Backup / Watch-Only / Signing Keys / Steganography, with a distinct icon per item.
- **Sign TX screen** gains "EXP. KPUB" and "SCAN PSKB" buttons (PSKB replaces KSPT in the step guide).
- **Sign-message SD save** prompts for a filename (auto-incremented `SG…TXT`) instead of overwriting a fixed file.
- **SeedQR numeric mode** for standard compliance (12-word → V2 25×25, 24-word → V3 29×29).
- **Expanded entropy sources**: SYSTIMER, eFuse MAC + unique ID, idle timing; camera sensor noise remains primary.
- **HD multisig address browser** (v1.1.0 foundations): navigate the shared cosigner address series on `MultisigShowAddress`; index is RAM-only.
- **UX polish**: SIGNER/FRAMES badges on multi-frame QR, unified multi-QR layout, single-sig skips the density picker, unlimited change-chain address browsing (on-demand derivation).

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Waveshare seed generation was deterministic**: every entropy source returned zeros (TRNG at the wrong register, camera reading stale PSRAM, SYSTIMER unlatched); the pool was SHA-256 of zeros on every generation. Fixed by reading the DMA write buffer, latching SYSTIMER, and mixing eFuse chip-unique data.
- **CRITICAL: all change addresses rendered as `kaspa:qqqqq…`**: the change chain was never derived; all three derive paths now populate `change_pubkey_cache`.
- **Multisig P2SH mismatch across devices**: own-key select now uses the account-level x-only pubkey (matching `import_kpub()`), so both devices build byte-identical scripts and the same P2SH address.
- **Multisig SD workflow**: descriptor buffer-overflow panic fixed (parse from the read buffer, no undersized copy); descriptor/address loads no longer route through the signed-TX pipeline; keyboard full-screen flashing removed (partial redraws); the trash button on file lists now deletes; M5 QR progress dots no longer hidden by the viewfinder.
- **Navigation & UX**: dead-space blink eliminated across menus and dialogs (redraw only on state change); context-aware back buttons; delete-active-seed auto-activates the next slot; instant sign-message feedback.

### Changed
- Zero clippy warnings (auto + manual fixes; targeted `#[allow]`s for embedded patterns).
- Labels: "Phone" → "Wallet" on kpub export; outputs are 1-indexed in the QR view.

## [1.0.2]: 2026-04-13

### Added: Device Firmware
- **cam_dma camera pipeline**: new DMA-based 480×480 YUV422 capture for Waveshare, replacing DvpCamera. Direct SYSTIMER register reads for QR decode performance timing.
- **OV2640 runtime auto-detect**: Waveshare now probes sensor ID at boot; OV2640 wide-angle supported alongside OV5640 (`camera_ov2640.rs`, `cam_dma.rs`)
- **kpub multi-frame QR export**: choose 2/3/4 frames, auto-cycle or manual navigation, save to SD, import from SD. New states: `ExportKpubFrameCount`, `ExportKpubModeChoice`, `ExportKpubPopup`, `KpubScannedPopup`, `SdKpubFileList`, `SdKpubFilename`
- **Signed QR frame size choice**: `ShowQrFrameChoice` lets user pick single vs multi-frame signed KSPT export
- **Multisig address SD save**: `MultisigSaveAddrAsk` state with optional encryption
- **SD overwrite confirmation**: generic `sd_overwrite_next`/`sd_overwrite_back` state machine prompts before overwriting existing files
- **SD file helpers**: extracted `sd_file_exists()`, `build_filename_83()`, `write_file_to_sd()`, `generate_trng_nonce()` as reusable functions
- **Multi-frame QR buffers expanded**: `MF_BUF` 2KB→5KB, `MF_RECEIVED`/`MF_FRAG_SIZE` 8→20 slots for larger KSPT payloads
- **Account-level PSKT signing fallback**: when address-level key doesn't match, tries account xonly pubkey (`acct.public_key_x_only()`)

### Fixed: Device Firmware
- **CST816D touch sensitivity**: threshold 0x28→0x50, low-power scan 0x10→0x20, auto-sleep disabled. Fixes ghost touches on Waveshare.

### Code Quality
- **Clippy cleanup**: zero warnings on `clippy::all` for both bootloader and KasSee WASM
- Inlined 38 format args, removed 9 unnecessary casts, added digit separators
- Eliminated 3× `Vec::clone()` in UTXO selection (sort in place, consume by value)
- QR SVG generation: `write!()` instead of `&format!()`: zero allocation per module
- `ws_rpc_call`: `.take()` instead of `.clone()` on WebSocket result
- `funded_addresses`: counts unique script_public_keys by reference
- Removed 7 redundant `#[allow(dead_code)]` directives
- 36 well-documented pedantic-tier `#[allow]` directives in `main.rs` for embedded patterns
- Removed dead code: `key_rect()` in pin_ui, `_word_idx` in sdcard_ws
- Removed orphaned zero-width text steganography code from `features/stego.rs` (unused constants, templates, `decode_stego_text()`, `contains_stego()`): JPEG EXIF stego uses base64, not ZW characters

### KasSee Web
- **Donate card**: rebuilt with fully inline styles, no CSS conflicts with app screens
- **Broadcast → Donate flow**: after successful TX, user sees donate card before dashboard
- **UTXO selection fix**: sort in place + consume by value; sweep now takes top 5 UTXOs by size
- Fixed `manifest.json`, `lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml` version strings to 1.0.2
- Orphan file cleanup: removed stale WASM copies and leftover CSS
- Three-way sync verified (GitHub, gh-pages, source repo)

### QR Decoder
- **rqrr no_std fork**: replaced custom per-platform decoders (`decoder_ws.rs`, `decoder_m5.rs`) with `rqrr_nostd`, a no_std zero-dependency fork of rqrr 0.10.1
- Supports V1 to V13, all ECC levels, full Reed-Solomon error correction
- Single-pass accept. Rqrr's RS verification replaces the old 5-pass voting (Waveshare) and 3-consecutive match (M5Stack) heuristics
- Unified `rqrr_decode()` in `camera_loop.rs` for both platforms
- Deleted `bootloader/src/qr/decoder_ws.rs` and `bootloader/src/qr/decoder_m5.rs`

### Infrastructure
- Bootloader `Cargo.toml` version bumped to 1.0.2
- Docker build tags updated to v1.0.2
- **Version cleanup**: removed hardcoded version strings from filenames, titles, and docs; splash screen now reads version dynamically from `CURRENT_VERSION`

### Hardware

## [1.0.1]: 2026-03-31

### Milestone: First Air-Gapped Multisig on Kaspa Mainnet
- **P2SH multisig**: fund and spend from M-of-N Pay-to-Script-Hash multisig addresses
- **Co-signing flow**: device A signs partial → QR → device B adds signature → fully signed
- **Two co-signing modes**: direct device-to-device QR, or via KasSee relay
- TX `8a6652fb...`: first P2SH multisig funding on Kaspa mainnet (air-gapped)
- TX `d1ffdb9f...`: first P2SH multisig spend (2-of-2, direct device-to-device)
- TX `2b53e35a...`: second P2SH funding (reversed kpub order, sorted keys verified)
- TX `2b718bd5...`: second P2SH multisig spend (2-of-2, via KasSee relay)

### Added: Device Firmware
- **P2SH script detection** (`OP_BLAKE2B OP_DATA_32 <hash> OP_EQUAL`) in transaction analysis
- **Redeem script** field on transaction inputs for P2SH round-trip
- **v2 KSPT serializer/parser** carries redeem scripts between signers
- **KSPT v1 flags 0x02**: optional redeem script per input for P2SH spending
- **ShowQR sig status overlay**: "PARTIAL 1/2" (orange) or "FULLY SIGNED 2/2" (teal)
- **Multi-frame v2 KSPT detection** in camera. Previously only single-frame v2 was recognized
- **QR frame padding**: last frame padded to minimum 20 bytes for reliable scanning
- **"No seed loaded"** warning replaces generic "TX Cancelled" when signing without a seed
- **BIP85 auto-load**: derived child seed loads into slot immediately after derivation
- **BIP85 success sound**: plays "tururi" (success) instead of "bip" (task_done)
- **Home button** on SD format warning screen (was dead zone)
- **Click sound** on back/home during format warning
- **SD backup delete** with hold-to-confirm (matches seed delete UX: CANCEL left, DELETE right, HOLD 4s)
- **SD file list** fingerprint matching ("Seed #1", "Seed #2" labels)
- **SD progress bars** on seed restore decrypt and xprv import
- **Pre-signing size check**: rejects transactions exceeding 1024-byte buffer with "Too many inputs! N inputs. Max 5. Compound first."
- **KSSN hex dump** as single line (was multi-line, required manual cleanup)
- **Hex buffer overflow** handled gracefully with warning (no panic)

### Fixed: Device Firmware
- **Sighash**: All sub-hashes and final digest now use keyed Blake2b-256 with `TransactionSigningHash` domain key (was unkeyed)
- **Output hash**: Added `script_len` (u64 LE) prefix before script bytes in `hash_output`
- **Schnorr challenge**: Switched from plain `SHA256(R||P||msg)` to BIP-340 tagged hash `SHA256(tag||tag||R||P||msg)`
- **Change address signing**: `find_address_index_for_pubkey` now searches both receive (m/.../0/x) and change (m/.../1/x) chains; returns `(index, is_change)` tuple; all 3 callers updated
- **No JPEG on SD loop**: stego export now returns to menu instead of looping
- **Import from SD "Saving"**: all read operations now show "Loading" screen
- **Multisig slot label overlap**: "Slot N" moved above delete button
- **MAX_SCRIPT_SIZE**: bumped from 64 to 170 bytes (supports up to 5-of-5 multisig)
- **QR frame payload**: reduced from 103 to 53 bytes for reliable device-to-device scanning
- "Wrong passphrase" → "Wrong password" on SD import failure
- Remaining Spanish comments translated to English

### Added: KasSee Web
